# üåå A Neuromorphic Approach for Space Weather Prediction and Magnetic Reconnection using LAVA

## üìñ Introduction
This is a research-driven project exploring neuromorphic computing for space weather prediction. It integrates machine learning, traditional clustering methods, and emerging neuromorphic techniques to forecast space weather severity and detect potential **magnetic reconnection events**. By leveraging real-time satellite data, this system provides early warnings for geomagnetic disruptions.

## ‚ùì Why Is This Important?
Space weather events, such as **solar storms and coronal mass ejections (CMEs)**, can severely impact **power grids, GPS systems, satellites, and communication networks**. Accurately predicting these events enables:
- **Better preparedness** for geomagnetic storms.
- **Reduced impact on infrastructure** (aviation, navigation, power grids).
- **Advancement in AI-driven space weather forecasting** using neuromorphic computing.

This project explores **Intel's LAVA SDK** to optimize predictions using neuromorphic methods, aiming for improved efficiency and performance compared to traditional ML approaches.
